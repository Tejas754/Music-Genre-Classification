# Music-Genre-Classification

In this project, I have downloaded all the necessary files through the !wget method. Then after extracting, I converted all the files to .wav format (originally they were .au). 
Next I created a JSON file containing the class mappings (i.e 'classical', 'rock', etc), labels for the respective mappings and the mfcc features.
